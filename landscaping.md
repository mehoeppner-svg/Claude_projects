## Backyard Renovation

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Payment Structure:** 50/50

### Scope
*(Add details: what was included - hardscape, plants, etc.)*

### What Went Well
- *(Add notes)*

### Lessons Learned
- **Did not include irrigation** — This was an oversight. Had to address watering manually or retrofit later. Future projects should include irrigation from the start.

## Front Yard Landscaping

**Status:** 🔄 In Planning  
**Estimated Cost:** ~$18,000  
**Payment Structure:** 50/50

### Scope Overview
- Cedar fencing
- Irrigation system (included this time)
- Trees and shrubs
- *(Add other elements)*

### Key Decisions

#### Fencing: Cedar vs Pressure-Treated Wood
**Decision:** Cedar

| Factor | Cedar | Pressure-Treated |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Aesthetics | Superior natural look | Greenish tint, less attractive |
| Durability | 15-20+ years | 10-15 years |
| Maintenance | Weathers to gray naturally, optional sealing | Requires regular treatment |
| Cost | Higher upfront | Lower upfront |
| Chemicals | Natural rot resistance | Treated with preservatives |

**Rationale:** Better long-term value, superior appearance, worth the upfront cost difference.

#### Irrigation
**Decision:** Include in project scope

Learning from backyard project — including irrigation upfront avoids the hassle and added expense of retrofitting later.

### Plant Selections

| Plant | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Anacocho Orchid Tree | Tree | Native to Texas, minimal care required, aligns with low-maintenance approach |
| *(Add others)* | | |

**Plant Selection Criteria:**
- Low maintenance (works with scheduled irrigation, occasional trimming only)
- Appropriate for Texas climate
- Native species preferred
