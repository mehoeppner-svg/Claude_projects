## Guiding Principles

Based on experience from completed projects:

1. **Include irrigation upfront** — Retrofitting is more expensive and disruptive
2. **Compare pricing across projects** — Ensure consistency with same contractor
3. **Research materials thoroughly** — e.g., cedar vs pressure-treated fence analysis
4. **Favor low-maintenance options** — Plants that work with scheduled irrigation and minimal care
5. **Document everything** — Proposals, decisions, lessons learned
